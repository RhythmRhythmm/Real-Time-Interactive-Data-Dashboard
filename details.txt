Project Structure and Technology Stack
The project uses a standard web development folder structure to keep the code organized and manageable.

data-dashboard/
├── index.html     (The website's structure)
├── style.css      (All the visual styling)
└── script.js      (All the interactive logic)

The core technologies used in this project are:

HTML5: Provides the fundamental structure and content of the dashboard, including all text, buttons, and placeholders for the charts and data cards.

CSS3: Handles the visual presentation, layout, and animations. It uses features like CSS variables for easy theming, Flexbox and Grid for responsive design, and keyframe animations for a dynamic feel.

JavaScript (ES6+): Powers all the interactivity. It handles user events, manipulates the DOM to display data, and drives the charts and animations.

Chart.js: A powerful third-party library used to create the interactive line and bar charts. It's loaded via a CDN directly in the HTML file.

Font Awesome: An icon library, also loaded via a CDN, that provides the icons for the insight cards and other elements.

How the Project Works: A File-by-File Breakdown
index.html - The Skeleton
This is the main file that defines the content and layout of your dashboard. It acts as the "skeleton" of the website.

The <head> section links to all the external resources: the style.css file for styling, the Inter font from Google Fonts, Font Awesome for icons, and the Chart.js library. It also includes the vital viewport meta tag to ensure the website is fully responsive on all devices.

The <body> section contains all the visible content. It's where the header, the marquee, the control panel with filters, the <div> containers for the insight cards, and the <canvas> elements for the charts are placed. This file only contains the structure; the appearance and functionality are handled by the other files.

style.css - The Aesthetics
This file is responsible for the entire visual appeal of the dashboard. It brings the plain HTML structure to life.

CSS Variables: It uses :root variables to define the color scheme (--navy-dark, --accent-blue, etc.). This makes it easy to change the entire theme by modifying just a few lines of code.

Layout and Responsiveness: The dashboard uses a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid to create a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly layout. Elements automatically adjust their size and position based on the screen size.

Animations and Effects: It includes keyframe animations like fadeIn and marquee to create engaging visual effects. The custom cursor trail is also styled here, which works in tandem with the JavaScript to follow the mouse.

script.js - The Brains
This file contains all the logic and interactivity. It's the "brain" that makes the dashboard dynamic.

Data Simulation: The DATASETS object is where all the data for the COVID-19 and Crypto sections is stored. In a real-world application, you would replace this object with a fetch call to a public API to get live data.

DOM Element Selection: The script first identifies all the important HTML elements (like the dropdown menus and chart canvases) by their unique IDs. This allows JavaScript to interact with them.

Initialization (initDashboard): The window.onload = initDashboard; line ensures that all the setup code runs as soon as the webpage finishes loading. This function creates the Chart.js chart instances and performs the initial data load.

UI Update Functions: Functions like updateDashboard, updateInsights, and updateCharts are the core of the dashboard. They dynamically inject HTML into the insights-grid to create the cards and update the data in the Chart.js canvases based on the user's selections.

Event Listeners: The setupEventListeners function listens for user actions. When you change the dataset or click the "Apply Filters" button, these events trigger the update functions, which in turn redraw the dashboard with the new data.

Custom Cursor Animation: The animateTrail function uses requestAnimationFrame to create a smooth and efficient animation loop. It constantly updates the position of the .cursor-trail element to follow the mouse, giving the website a unique and interactive feel.

Together, these files create a cohesive, responsive, and dynamic web application. The HTML provides the structure, the CSS provides the style, and the JavaScript provides the intelligence.
